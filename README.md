# otsusmethod
This QGIS plugin provides a streamlined tool for performing automated thresholding on raster datasets using Otsu's method. The plugin reads raster data, converts it to greyscale, and applies Otsuâ€™s algorithm to compute an optimal threshold, creating binary output for clearer visual distinction of segmented areas. Additionally, it offers a visual report that includes the original RGB image, greyscale image, binary thresholded image, and a histogram with the calculated threshold marked.
