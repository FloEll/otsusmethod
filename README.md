# Otsu's Method for Raster Data Segmentation
![icon](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/980e9fdd-0c06-42e9-9e1d-541d49f2e808)

This QGIS plugin provides a streamlined tool for performing automated thresholding on raster datasets using Otsu's method. The plugin reads raster data, converts it to greyscale, and applies Otsuâ€™s algorithm to compute an optimal threshold, creating binary output for clearer visual distinction of segmented areas. Additionally, it offers a visual report that includes the original RGB image, greyscale image, binary thresholded image, and a histogram with the calculated threshold marked.
