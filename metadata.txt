about=This QGIS plugin provides a streamlined tool for performing automated thresholding on raster datasets using Otsu's method. The plugin reads raster data, converts it to greyscale, and applies Otsu’s algorithm to compute an optimal threshold, creating binary output for clearer visual distinction of segmented areas. Additionally, it offers a visual report that includes the original RGB image, greyscale image, binary thresholded image, and a histogram with the calculated threshold marked.
